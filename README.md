## source_notebooks

# About me
Hi, I'm Abhi. A Data enthusiast. I love analyzing, researching, organizing and generating meaningful insights out of structured/unstructured data.

# Yelp dataset
Note, these exercises were put together using Round 12 of Yelp's
challenge. Currently Yelp are on round 13. I haven't revisited the exercises
using the newer dataset. I hope you still get sensible answers, but let
me know if this causes you any difficulties. If you'd like the original
dataset (from round 12) let me know. If this option is popular I may
devote some of my Google drive to hosting it.
